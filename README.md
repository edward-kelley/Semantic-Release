## What is `semantic-release` about?

At its core `semantic-release` is a set of conventions that gives you entirely automated, semver-compliant package publishing. _Coincidentally_ these conventions make sense on their own, like having meaningful commit messages.

The next branch is a completely rewritten version of `semantic-release`, that isn't fully tested and documented yet.
It has lots and lots of great new features, but also breaks a lot of things.
Unless you're adventurous you should look at the [stable master branch](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/tree/master).
